# Personal Webpage Project

## Overview
This project is a personal webpage that showcases various aspects of my life, including my background, education, skills, hobbies, and favorite destinations. The webpage is structured to provide a clear and engaging presentation of information, with sections dedicated to each topic.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

- **index.html**: The main webpage featuring my name, job title, personal presentation, favorite quote, and sections for Background, Education, Skills, Hobbies, and a navigation link to the destinations page. It includes images and tables for layout.
  
- **about.html**: A page that provides additional information about me, including my background, education, skills, and hobbies, along with relevant images.

- **destinations.html**: This page contains five sections, each dedicated to a different travel destination. Each section includes a picture, title, description, and a list of facts about the destination, along with a back link to the homepage.

- **contact.html**: A page that includes a contact form for visitors to reach out to me, along with my contact information.

- **images/**: A directory for storing all image files used in the project, including personal images, school logos, and images for the destinations.

- **css/style.css**: A stylesheet that contains styles for the webpage, including layout adjustments, font styles, colors, and responsive design elements.

- **js/script.js**: A JavaScript file for any functionality that may be added, such as form validation or interactive elements.
